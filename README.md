This project involved analyzing product-level sales data from Zepto (sourced from Kaggle) to uncover key business insights and support data-driven decision-making. The primary goal was to explore sales trends and understand product performance across various categories.

As the Data Analyst, I was responsible for the full lifecycle of the analysis. This included:

Data cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, null values, and standardized the dataset.

Grouping and aggregations: Grouped data by product categories to calculate metrics like total sales, average price, and quantity sold.

Subqueries and filtering: Used SQL subqueries to identify the most profitable products, top-selling items, and price trends.

Category classification: Segmented products into low, medium, and bulk categories based on weight and quantity thresholds.

Identified items with the highest MRP, frequent stock-outs, and discount patterns to assess inventory and pricing strategies.

Key Results:

Highlighted the most profitable and top-selling products.

Identified pricing inefficiencies and high-performing categories.

Provided insights into product availability and stock issues.

Tools Used:

SQL (for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis)

My Role:
I independently managed and executed all stages of the project, from data preparation to final insights. My work focused on turning raw sales data into clear, actionable insights that could help optimize product offerings and pricing strategies for better profitability.# Zepto_Data_Set-Project
